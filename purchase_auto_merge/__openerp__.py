Purchase Auto Merge
===================

With this module, the purchase orders generated by the procurement
scheduler are in *draft* state with the *lock* flag.

When a new procurement is generated:

* if there is already a *lock* purchase order for this supplier, the
procurement scheduler will increase the quantities in this *lock*
purchase order ;

* otherwise, the procurement scheduler will create a new *lock* purchase order.

WARNING : you need to modify your addons to make this module work.
In fact, you need to get the code of this merge proposal :
